This repository contains an in-depth analysis of global cancer patient data from 2015 to 2024, exploring the influence of genetic risk, cancer stage at diagnosis, gender, and environmental factors on survival outcomes and disease severity. Conducted by [Zeina Shalaan]https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeina-shalaan-86b078307/, [Mira Micheal]https://www.linkedin.com/in/mira-m-2061a4322/ , [Maya Shalash]https://www.linkedin.com/in/maya-shalash-13a251356/ , [Mennatallah Amr]https://www.linkedin.com/in/mennatallah-amr-mostafa-ab72282a2/

# **Hypotheses**
1. Does cancer stage at diagnosis have a stronger impact on survival than genetic risk?
Null Hypothesis (H₀) 1: No difference in the influence of genetic predisposition and cancer stage on survival.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁) 1: Cancer stage at diagnosis significantly affects survival more than genetic risk.

2. Is there a difference in cancer stage distribution between males and females?
Null Hypothesis (H₀) 2: No difference in cancer stage distribution between genders.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁) 2: Gender influences cancer stage at diagnosis.

# **Dataset & Methodology**
Source: Kaggle Dataset - Global Cancer Patients (2015-2024)

Sample: 8,400 patients (25% of total dataset), with further 6% subsampling for detailed analysis.

Methods:

- ANOVA (cancer stage vs. severity).

- Chi-squared test (gender vs. stage distribution).

- Correlation analysis (genetic risk, survival, environmental factors).

- Bootstrapping (mean age, genetic risk, pollution, etc.).
